# Data-analysis-of-Automobile-dataset

ENGO 645 - Spatial Databases & DataMining

## Overview:
This project is the answer to the third assignment for the course (ENGO 645 - Spatial Databases & DataMining) that is taught at the University of Calgary. On this Project, I cleaned and processed the [**Automobile dataset**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data) by utilizing different techniques of data analysis, such as normalization, correlation analysis, ... etc. Additionally, the visualization of the dataset attributes is proposed in this project (the scatter and box plots) for a better understanding of the pattern and correlation of the attributes. You can find all the requirements of the project in this [**link**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GriSoKZpZ0bY5_geqha-zzAvEzkh6SHS/view?usp=sharing). 


## System requirement:
- Any platform you like such as Windows, Linux, and so on. 
- python 3.6 or higher

## Libraries required to install:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
You can find all of these libraries in the `requirements.txt` and install all of them by running this command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal window.

## How to run the project:
* After installing all libraries required in your environment, run `convert_dataFile_to_CSVFile.py` in any IDE you like for converting the automobile dataset file `imports-85.data` that is located in the asset folder to a CSV file. 
* Then, run the `main.py` file to start the procedure of data processing and cleaning. You will notice after running that there are two folders (`out_files`and `out_figures`) are created that contain all output files and figures after processing and cleaning data.
